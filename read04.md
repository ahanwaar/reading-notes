# Dynamic web pages with JavaScript
## What is JavaScript?
- JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.
- JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. 

Therefore, if the web page was a human being, then the JS would be its functional device that controls all its parts.

## What are JavaScript Data Types?

| Data Type     | Example                                    |
| ------------- |:------------------------------------------:|
| String        | 'Eat Healthy',"Don't smoke", "BMI", '1 + 5'|
| Number        | 55                                         | 
| boolean       | true, or false                             |  

## What are JavaScript Variables?
JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.
### Example:

```
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
```

## What are JavaScript Operators?
- JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
- JavaScript Assignment Operators
- JavaScript Comparison Operators
- JavaScript Logical Operators
- JavaScript Type Operators


### JavaScript Arithmetic Operators

|  Operator     | Description                    |
| ------------- |:------------------------------:|
| `+`           | Addition                       |
| `-`           | Subtraction                    | 
| `*`           | Multiplication                 |  
| `**`          | Exponentiation                 |
| `/`           | Division                       | 
| `%`           | Modulus (Division Remainder)   |  
| `++`          | Increment                      | 
| `--`          | Decrement                      | 

### JavaScript Comparison Operators

|  Operator     | Description                    |
| ------------- |:------------------------------:|
| `==`          | equal to                       |
| `===`         | equal value and equal type     | 
| `!=`          | not equal                      |  
| `!==`         | not equal value or not equal type |
| `>`           | greater than                   | 
| `<`           | less than                      |  
| `>=`          | greater than or equal to       | 
| `<=`          | less than or equal to          | 
| `?`           | ternary operator               | 

## JavaScript if else and else if
Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:
- Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
- Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

```
if (condition1) {
  //  block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}
```
