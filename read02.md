# Git, Github & VCS
## What is VCS?
VCS stands for Version Control System, which is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.

# What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system which stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

Git can keep a snapshots of the desired project, allows the team to do local changes on the project, tracking the changes, etc.
